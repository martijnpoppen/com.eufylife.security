Install instructions (French)

Because of the way the Eufy Security private API works, an email/password combo cannot
work with both the Eufy Security mobile app and the Homey app. 

It is recommended to use the mobile Eufy app to create a secondary "admin" account with a separate email address
and use it with this app.

Usage
- Install this app on your Homey.
- Go to `add devices` 
- Provide your Username and Password. Click Next
- Available devices show up
