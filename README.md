# Eufy Security

Add support for Eufy Cam in Homey.
Link: https://homey.app/nl-nl/app/com.eufylife.security/Eufy-Security/

# Account Information

Because of the way the Eufy Security private API works, an email/password combo cannot
work with _both_ the Eufy Security mobile app _and_ this library. It is recommended to
use the mobile app to create a secondary "guest" account with a separate email address
and use it with this library.

# Usage
- Install this app on your Homey.
- Go to `add devices` 
- Provide your Username and Password. Click Next
- Available devices show up
